# Boris' raytracer challenge
Hello this is me, implementing [the raytracer challenge](http://raytracerchallenge.com/) book by Jamis Buck.

## why
I saw [MrJakob's implementation](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-2w7N7aCqs_QclGUtXkSqg), and wanted to try for myself.

I am recording the attempt as learning material (mostly for me but hopefully it can help others) and may even stream some parts on twitch.
I need to train :
- my TDD skills
- my spoken english
- my teaching/presentation skills

## how
JS (+ maybe some wasm optims in the future ?)
NO library, as few modules as possible (fs mainly)
TDD (of course)

I'll try to make it one chapter = one vid
